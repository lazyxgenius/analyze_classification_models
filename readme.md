# Classification Models on Wine Dataset

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation and training of multiple classification algorithms (and GridSearchCV) using the Wine dataset from scikit-learn. It also includes options for experimenting with the MNIST dataset.

## Contents

1. **Dataset Loading**: 
   - The primary dataset used is the Wine dataset.
   - Additional code for the MNIST dataset is available for further experimentation.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Data is loaded and structured using Pandas for ease of analysis and model training.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Multiple classifiers are applied to the dataset to evaluate their performance. 
   - Algorithms include various models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Visualizations may be included to compare the performance of different models.

## Usage

Run the cells in sequence to load the data, train models, and evaluate their performance. Adjust the parameters or swap datasets to explore different scenarios.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib (if visualizations are included)
